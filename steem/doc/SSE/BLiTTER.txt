BLiTTER

This not a full documentation for the Atari blitter (Mega ST, STE),
but some useful partial information for emulation.


Bus arbitration

Bus arbitration takes 4 clock cycles, whether it's CPU->Blitter 
or Blitter->CPU arbitration.
The CPU can run during bus arbitration, if it doesn't access the bus.

Both the CPU and the blitter can grant the bus in the middle of an operation,
an instruction for the CPU, a blit for the blitter (if it is in blit mode).

Not tested: when the CPU is in exception mode, we assume it keeps the bus.

Blit mode

In Blit mode, the CPU and the blitter have alternative access to the bus for 
a while until the blit is finished.
Not clock cycles but bus accesses are counted! (thx Cyprian)
This is why couting blit and CPU cycles was so much trouble.

For its first run, the blitter gets 63 bus accesses.
Generally, the program restarts the blitter at once in blit mode. That
way, the blit is fast while interruptions are fielded.
If the blitter is so restarted, it gets 64 bus accesses each time.
If it isn't restarted, it will restart by itself after the CPU has accessed
the bus 64 times, and it will get 63 bus accesses. There's also a latency of
4 clock cycles after the 64th CPU access and when bus arbitration begins.

The blitter will restart by itself in TOS, during interrupts because TOS 
doesn't pause it.
