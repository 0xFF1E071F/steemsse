Steem SSE Bugs
===================

v3.7.2

Notes
1) "Correct" means it's no Steem bug AFAIK.
2) Please don't report bugs that are already known, think of my reputation!


-20year / pdx bad sound (correct)

-36.15 HMD giga: 
cracks in sound
freezes after a while if no Hacks

-Amazine 4/Impact: often crashes at start (correct)

-Antiques: end scroller (correct)

-Arkanoid 2: ball ghosting (correct)

-BIG demo
screen 1: overscan flicker on STE (correct)
screen 2: sometimes monochrome rasters! (now they'll find a body)

-Blitter: the rare case where a CPU instruction is executed while the
blitter is working isn't emulated.

-Brattacas: poor control (correct)

-CAPS: no fast mode

-Checking option 6301/ACIA during emulation may crash Steem

-Changing display settings during emulation may crash Steem

-Civilization STX HD install fails at disk A (correct)

-Crash possible when Windows automatically blocks the session

-Dizzy Panic 1 player/start switching (correct)

-Dynabuster+ flicker at scores (correct)

-GEMDOS hard disk emulation in EMUTOS 

-Eye of Horus -MCA (correct)

-F-29 crashes on 4MB STE (correct)

-File associations lost at new version

-Hades Nebula sometimes fails to start

-hard disk emu, Steem won't let you save memory

-hi-fi dreams should sound better on STE

-International Tennis 3D: controls don't respond right (correct)

-Japtro hangs in STE mode (correct)

-Jumping Jackson on Automation 239: sometimes crashes at start game

-Keyboard: sometimes won't take input anymore - quit Steem and start again

-Lose picture at stop with 400x278 display size
Due to DirectDraw hacks

-lowlife 60

-MB31 ?

-Microprose Golf STX: current pasti.dll has some wrong timings, not
up to Steem (ST, IPF versions OK).

-Mono emulator!

-My Dog is Enjoying Fuzion skull screen crash (correct)

-Notator: instrument assignment?

-Oh no more froggies: ADAT too slow (STW ok)

-Options may be messed up when going from earlier versions of Steem
to the most recent one (I do that all the time for tests).

-Pacemaker credits line 70 flicker/shift with large borders,
noise without

-Pacemaker credits crash at end (correct)

-Panic v1
frequent video shift, lose overscan if no 'Hacks'

-Pasti: failure on resume snapshot

-Pasti: some games that work in Hatari don't in Steem; timings are not 
accurate.
This is because pasti.dll should be improved, the fault isn't on
Steem's side.

-Random crashes and failures... (rare)

-Realm of the Trolls STX bad init disc (STW/HFE)

-ReDMCSB fails halfway in TOS1.02 (you can compile 50%!)
Is it Steem or TOS bug?

-SCP no fast mode

-Snapshot: can't save when HD files open (big problem!)

-Snapshot: poor STW and SCP resuming

-Star Trek 
samples too noisy

-Status info may disappear when you play around with windows

-Steem 3.2+ crashes (back to OS) on resuming when Pasti was on

-Steem SSE uses more CPU power than Steem 3.2

-Steem is unable to take advantage of multiple cores in 'fast forward' mode.

-STE microwire; treble control doesn't work

-STW no fast mode

-Switching between versions of Steem may corrupt auto.sts and cause crashes

-Ultimate 3D dots STE can fail to load
correct? hangs even more on real STE + HXC (TODO: real drive?)

-Warp STX may fail
