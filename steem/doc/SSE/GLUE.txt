Introduction
==============

The proper acronym is GLU for "Generalized Logic Unit".
It's generally spelled GLUE or Glue. 
As the name suggests, this IC glues the system together. 
It is responsible for address decoding and providing 'chip select' (CS) lines.
It also handles the control of interrupt lines to the CPU, and bus arbitration 
between CPU and DMA. 
It also creates the video timing signals.
In the STE, the GLUE and the MMU are one single chip, the GST MCU.


Registers
===========

From the ST IO address map.

$FFFF820A   R/W             |------xx|   Sync Mode
                                   ||
                                   | ----   External/_Internal Sync
                                    -----   50 Hz/_60 Hz Field Rate

Bit 1 corresponds to the monitor refresh rate (0 for 60Hz, 1 for 50 Hz).
We'll call this register SYNC.

(SYNC&2)==0  (and MODE<2) <-->  Frequency==60Hz
(SYNC&2)==2  (and MODE<2) <-->  Frequency==50Hz


$FFFF8260   R/W             |------xx|   Shift Mode
                                   ||
                                   00       320 x 200, 4 Plane
                                   01       640 x 200, 2 Plane
                                   10       640 x 400, 1 Plane
                                   11       Reserved


This byte can have  one of 3 values:  0 for low-,  1 for middle- and  2 for
high-resolution.  The GLUE needs this register,  because in high-resolution
the picture is displayed at ~70 Hz which requires different synchronization
signal.

We notice 2 things:
1) if shift mode=3 ("reserved"), it's considered as 2 (HIRES) by the Glue
(demo "Oyster")
2) display timings are the same for low res and medium res, as tested on
a STE.
We conclude that only bit1 is memorised/considered by the Glue.
The Shifter needs 2 bits.
Register MODE is held in the Shifter, line HIRES is held in the Glue.

Internal registers
-------------------

The Glue must use some other registers to know where it is in the frame.
Those counters run continuously.

HCTR   position in HBL

The precision of this counter isn't known. Is it 4 CPU cycles, as in Alien's
article, 2 CPU cycles, as some cases seem to imply?
Not knowing any better we'll use the CPU precision (emulator cycles).


VCTR   HBL#

Vertical counter, starting from the "VSync" signal, when the electron beam is 
normally completely reset. It isn't important if the beam is at the very top
or at the very bottom.
The vertical counter is  incremented every line, i.e.  at every edge of  the HBL
signal, and reset on each edge of the VBL.
The first border line depends on the monitor.
The first useful line is 63 at 50hz and 34 at 60hz or 71hz.
In Steem, this line corresponds to scan_y=0.
The last useful line is 247 (?)
The last border line depends on the monitor.


Additional registers we guess:


H_END    position of last cycle of this line (224, 508, 512)

The GLue decides the value of this line at cycle 54, in function of MODE and
SYNC.
For example, a line -106, stopped because the ST was in HIRES at cycle 164, 
will still run 512 cycles if it was at 50hz at cycles 54.


Additional registers on the STE:

4bit  HSCROLL  If HSCROLL<>0, video memory must be fetched in advance.
How it exactly happens is speculative, but the Glue/MMU, as well as the
Shifter, need the info.
Precise HSCROLL (4bit) is held in the Shifter, a HSCROLL yes/no line is held in
the Glue.


Signals
=========

Bus error
----------



Video
------

The GLUE: Produces the vertical and  horizontal synchronization signals.  It
also produces signals telling the SHIFTER  when it should display the useable
screen   and  when it should show the background  colour 0  (corresponding to
the border).
It also tells the MMU when to send data to the SHIFTER.

Note: actual traces show that DE starts before image can be displayed and stops
while it's still being displayed.

The GLUE generates the DE, Vsync, Hsync and Blank signals:

- The DE (Display Enable) signal  tells the  SHIFTER when to display the  border
  and when it has to display the  usable screen.  It also tells the MMU  when to
  send data to the SHIFTER:  It is unnecessary  to send  data and  increment the
  video counter  while the  border is  displayed.  If you cut the track  of this
  signal you will obtain a  "hardware" overscan (thanks to Aragorn who confirmed
  this by doing it). However, due to stability issues, this is  not recommended.
  The Autoswitch Overscan board (see ST Magazine 50) works in a very similar way
  by controlling this signal.

  DE is on when two internal signals are on: V (for vertical) and H (for
  horizontal).

- The Blank signal forces the  RGB colour outputs to zero  just before,  during,
  and just after the Hsync and Vsync synchronization signals.  Indeed,  monitors
  require the video signal  to be 0 volts  (black colour) before  every synchro-
  nization pulse (implemented as a negative voltage): Even the border colour has
  to be eliminated to prevent overlaying the border colour over the screen while
  the electron beam returns to the beginning of the next line (from the screen's
  right to its left)  and to the next picture  (from the screen's bottom  to its
  top).  Note that the Blank signal isn't used if the screen is displaying high-
  resolution.

The Vsync and Hsync sync signals are added to the video signal:

- Vsync is the  vertical synchronization signal which specifies where the top of
  the picture is located  in the video stream.  The VBL interrupt corresponds to
  an edge of this signal.

- Hsync is the horizontal synchronization signal. It generates the HBL interrupt
  (vector $68).  The HBL interrupt  should not be confused  with the Timer B
  interrupt (vector $120)  which is generated  when the DE signal goes low on an
  input of the MFP:  The Timer B interrupt is triggered  only,  when the useable
  screen is displayed, because DE is inactive during upper and lower border.

Knowing that  the GLUE  handles these signals,  it  seems logical  that it would
control the process of displaying the  screen. To do this, it would  require two
counters:

- a vertical counter:   the number of currenly displayed line

- a horizontal counter: the position within the line currently being output



Bus
=====

There's two data buses in the ST, the CPU bus and the DRAM / Shifter bus. 
The two are bridged by a bus gateway - a buffer and a latch, controlled by 
RDAT, WDAT and LATCH on the MMU.

The DRAM bus is segmented by MMU into two phases each of two 8MHz cycles,
one of which is a CPU phase and the other of which is a video / refresh
(and sound on the STE) phase. If the CPU tries to access DRAM or the Shifter
on a video phase, DTACK is withheld for two clock cycles to insert a pair of
wait states and align the access onto the CPU phase. But anything only on 
the CPU bus (including Glue and the MMU itself, at least in the STFM) can 
be accessed on any phase.


-->TODO



DE-Load latency
=================

The Shifter may load only when the MMU has fetched the video data
and put it on the bus, so the actual fetching happens (at least)
2 cycles before.

Traces show a higher latency between signal DE and signal LOAD.
This latency depends on the wake-up state of the ST when it's booted.

On the graph: 575.35-574.6 =  0.75 microseconds
500ns = 4 CPU cycles (~8.000 MHz...)
750ns = 6 CPU cycles


CPU-GLUE  |   DE-to-LOAD |  Prefetch
 offset   |    latency   |   latency 
----------------------------------------
    0     |      3       |     0 or 1
    1     |      4       |     1 or 2
    2     |      5       |     2 or 3
    3     |      6       |     3 or 4


On the graph, we observe a delay of 3-6 cycles, according to
wake-up state, between DE and LOAD, but the Shifter can LOAD only
when data has been fetched and is on the bus, so the delay between
real signal DE and MMU fetching video memory is only 1-4 cycles, assuming
2 cycles between fetch and LOAD.

This implies that 'DE' isn't asserted at cycle 52 (60hz) or 56 (50hz), but
some 8 cycles later.

DE on timing = 56 + 8 + WS offset = 64 + WS offset


On the graph we also see that DE stops before LOAD.
The MMU stops fetching at once, but the Shifter is 2 cycles behind.
The Shifter must still shift and display the memory it loads, so
DE doesn't stop that at once.

We wonder what use the Shifter makes of DE!


It seems the latency between DE on and 1st LOAD is longer than between
DE off and last LOAD.

DE off timing = 376 + 8 + WS offset = 384 + WS offset

Hsync on        339
Blank off pixel 400
DE on           421
DE off          667

De off - DE on = 246 pixels for 320 cycles


There would be 27,3 cycles between blank off and DE on

Blank off at 50hz = 32
32+27.3 = 59.3

STE
=====

The frequency check happens at cycles 36 for 60hz and 40 for 50hz instead
of 52 and 56, whatever the value of HSCROLL.
But prefetch starts (some) 16 cycles earlier only if HSCROLL is non null.
This value of 16 cycles is the same in medium resolution.
Prefetch ends as on a STF (cycle 376 at 50hz) because when HSCROLL 
is non null, an extra raster is fetched to complete the line.
When HSCROLL is null, the last prefetch also occurs at cycle 376, as
on the STF. This points to prefetch having the same timing as on the
STF when this condition is fulfilled.





DE
====


from STF schematics, we draw such graphic concerning DE signal:



GLUE ----------------T--------- MMU
                     |
                     |
                     +--------- Shifter
                     |
                     |
                     +--------- MFP (timer B in)


We know the DE timings for timer B and for MMU are different!
For example, GLUE stops DE and MMU stops fetching at cycle 376.
But the Shifter keeps on displaying and timer B isn't toggled until
cycle 404 (28 cycles later).



We would better understand such graphic:

GLUE ------------DE-----------> MMU
                                 |
                                 | LOAD
                                 |                     
                                 V                    
MFP (timer B in) <-----DE------Shifter
