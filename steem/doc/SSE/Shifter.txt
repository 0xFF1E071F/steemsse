Introduction
==============

The Shifter in the Atari ST is a custom chip. Since it has no other reference,
we'll call it "the Shifter" with a big S. Many people write it SHIFTER.
As the name implies, the role of a shifter is to shift data.
It takes words (16 bit) as input, shift those and use bits one by one, to 
address the palette and send the image to the screen. According to shift mode,
the bits of 2 or 4 bit planes are combined.
It is necessary to shift and combine different bit planes because
pixels are stored that way in memory. They're stored that way to
save memory. 
This makes programming video effects the harder.


Other chips
=============

Other chips are involved in producing the video output: GLUE, MMU. See
the respective files to get a complete picture (lol).

The Shifter receives DE but it's not clear what it does with it.
We don't think it is used to switch border/picture, because the timings
would be off. DE comands fetching by the MMU, which introduces a delay
before rendering is done.



Registers
===========

The addresses are those used on the ST, they map somewhere in the Shifter,
but we don't know the internal addresses.

                         red    green    blue

  These 16 registers serve exactly the same purpose as in the ST. 
  The only difference is that each Nibble for Red, Green or Blue 
  consists of 4 bits instead of 3 on the ST.

  For compatibility reasons, each nibble encoding the Red, Green or Blue
   values is not ordered "8 4 2 1", meaning the least significant 
   bit represents the value "1" while the most significant one represents 
   the value "8" - This would make the STE rather incompatible with the ST 
   and only display dark colours. The sequence of Bits is "0 3 2 1" encoding 
   the values "1 8 4 2". Therefore to fade from black to white, the sequence 
   of colours would be $000, $888, $111, $999, $222, $AAA, ...


Input
-----


IR1-4: Input registers
Video RAM is fetched by the MMU word by word and the IR registers are filled one
by one.
Each register is 16bit.
This process is the same for all shift modes.
When DE is set by the GLUE, prefetch starts and takes 16 cycles in all modes.

SS:

Alien says that DE causes the shifter to display picture instead of border,
but this is incompatible with the idea of prefetch.

There is also a latency of 12 cycles total for all shift modes before shifting
is effective.
You add this to prefetch time to know the difference between 'DE' cycle
and 'render' cycle, that is, 28.

IRI: input register index
This guessed register may be just 2bit. 
It indexes IR registers so that the Shifter knows where to copy the word put 
on the data bus by the MMU when it receives the LOAD signal.



Shift
-----

SR1-4: Shift Registers
Each register is 16bit.
Those 16bit registers do the actual shifting from right to left.
For each pixel, there's one shift. The leftmost bits of SR form the pixel.
The new rightmost bit is a 0.


Shift mode 0

  0/1 <- SR1 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
  0/1 <- SR2 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
  0/1 <- SR3 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
  0/1 <- SR4 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]

Video out


When the 4 IR are filled, they're copied at once on SR1-4.
Shift begins. In higher modes, shift is faster and the register
feeding the video out are fed by other shift registers.

SS:
The transfer from SR3 to SR1, etc., may be progressive, both
registers shifting, or immediate as Alien states.
But is it electronically possible to have, for example, 4 registers shifting
at 32Mhz for shift mode 2?


Toggling?
---------
SS:
Question: doesn't this operation of copying IR->SR take time?
There's no way that it takes less than 1 CPU cycle.
Is it possible that instead of IR and SR, we would have two sets of SR,
and while one is being filled the other is shifting?
Or, to explain the latency, is it possible that 12 cycles are needed to
copy from IR to SR, and that we have IR and two sets of SR?

$FFFF8260   R/W             |------xx|   Shift Mode

                                   01       640 x 200, 2 Plane
                                   10       640 x 400, 1 Plane
                                   11       Reserved

Alien:
    Both the GLUE and the SHIFTER have a copy of this register.
    The SHIFTER needs this register because  it needs to know  how to decode the
    picture data (as 4, 2 or 1 bitplanes) and whether to send the picture out to
    the RGB pins or the monochrome pin. Indeed, if one of these pins are active,
    the other is low.  The "hardware"  proof is  that the SHIFTER  receives  the
    address bus signals A1 to A5 (no need for A0 because every address is even).
    However only A1 to A4 would be sufficient to access the palette.
SS:
He means that with 4 bits you can address 16 registers, if there's one more
bit you can address 32 registers. On the STF only the Shift Mode register is
necessary, but on the STE there's also HSCROLL.

If the MMU needs to address the IR registers, 5 bits are also needed, even
without the need for a Mode register. Though, naturally, the Shifter must
know the mode somehow.


STE Scrolling
-------------

$FFFF8264 HSCROLL2 STE-only
Not documented
This is an odd register, when you change hscroll below to non-zero each
scanline becomes 4 words longer to allow for extra screen data. This register
sets hscroll but doesn't do that, instead the left border is increased by
16 pixels. If you have got hscroll extra fetch turned on then setting this
to 0 confuses the Shifter and causes it to shrink the left border by 16 pixels.


$FFFF8265 HSCROLL STE-only


This is a theory built on ggn's text.
Scrolling is implemented without extra shift registers.

DE and prefetch start earlier on STE:
16 cycles earlier in mode 0
8 cycles earlier in mode 1
4 cycles earlier in mode 2

Let's call this amount of cycles 'PreStart'.

The usual prefetch by the MMU happens so that IR1-4 are filled and copied
to SR1-4.

During PreStart cycles after prefetch, the Shifter will delay 16-HSCROLL times 
and shift SRi HSCROLL times. The delay is necessary for the display to be
correctly aligned. During those PreStart cycles, border colour is
displayed. The MMU starts fetching for other rasters during those
PreStart cycles, that is, it didn't stop. It fetches as many words as
necessary for the shift mode (4 in mode 0, 2 in mode 1, 1, in mode 2).

After PreStart+Prefetch+Latency cycles (84 in low res), at the usual location,
 pixels start to be displayed. This is an incomplete raster (16-HSCROLL).
Other rasters are prefetched, shifted and displayed as usual.

For the last raster, that is the extra raster on the right of the screen, it
is fetched but only HSCROLL pixels are displayed. After those pixels, the
Shifter shifts the rest (to empty the registers) but displays border colour.
