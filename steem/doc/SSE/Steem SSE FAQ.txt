Steem SSE FAQ
---------------

v3.9.1

Q:
What is the Atari ST?
A:
The Atari ST was the best 16bit computer.


Q:
What is Steem?
A:
Steem stands for STE Emulation Engine.
It's an excellent Atari STE emulator for the PC coded by Anthony and
Russel Hayward.


Q:
Where are Steem authors?
A:
They suddenly disappeared in the lower border, never to be seen again...
Before that they released the source of their great emulator, mercifully.


Q:
What is 'SSE'?
A:
SSE stands for 'Steven Seagal Edition', a branch of Steem, and the only one
with active development and exciting new features.


Q:
Is Steem really being improved by Steven Seagal?
A:
How unlikely does it sound to you? Don't you think it's more fun than
churning out crappy DTV movies?


Q:
Why should I use the SSE version and not the older version?
A:
Steem was already very compatible, but Steem SSE is even more so, with
better sound emulation, more disk image formats handled, many cool options,
bugfixes, etc. 
Steem SSE works better on more recent systems. The old Steem consumes less
CPU.


Q:
Why use Steem SSE and not emulator X or Y?
A:
For the nice GUI, for very high compatibility, for some unique features.


Q:
How much does it cost?
A:
Steem is free software.


Q:
How does it work?
A:
To use Steem, you need a copy of the Atari ROM, called "TOS", and some 
image disk files. 
When you first launch Steem, you may indicate where they are, which you can
change later.
Disk images are easy to find.
Legally this is still copyrighted material, and if they really wanted,
companies who own it could call a halt on emulation, but they don't.


Q:
What is TOS?
A:
The system ROM.
Including the BIOS, the GEM graphic environment and other layers, the full OS,
except on very early models (also emulated), was printed on a ROM chip. You need
an image of one of those roms to use Steem.

To get started you will find some TOS on the Steem SSE site:

http://ataristeven.exxoshost.co.uk/Other_downloads.htm
or here:
http://www.avtandil.narod.ru/tose.html


Q:
What do STE and STF stand for?
A:
STE is ST Extraordinary and STF is ST Fantastic.
Seriously: 
ST=Sixteen Thirty-two, a reference to the 16/32 architecture.
STF= ST Floppy, because the floppy drive is integrated in the console.
STE= ST Enhanced, because it has more features, like hardware scrolling,
stereo sound, etc.
The STF came before the STE. The STE is better but most programs targeted
the STF for commercial reasons.


Q:
Which ST model should I select?
A:
It depends on the program you need to run. Some programs are STF-only,
others are STE-only. If you don't know, a good bet is to start with STE
since this computer had more features. 
But then again, many programs wouldn't run on a STE (so this is not always
an emulation bug if something works in STF mode but not STE).
Please check the Hints textfile where some exclusive STF or STE
programs are listed.


Q:
With Display size 413x275, the left border seems larger than the right border.
A:
I think it is correct emulation. Believe me, it's been a pain to implement.


Q:
Weren't programs better on the Amiga anyway?
A:
Generally, serious applications were better on the ST, thanks to a
better file system and the no-nonsense GEM operating system, working hard 
disks and the outstanding monochrome monitor.
The Amiga OS was more groundbreaking (multitask) but at the same time fragile
(no memory protection).
Games were better animated on the Amiga, but the Atari ST is one of
the contenders for best chip music. 
The sound of the Amiga was impressive back then but is nothing more
than bad 8bit samples today (ouch!), and it was quickly outclassed by
the Soundblaster. A remark you'll read more and more.
Some important games of the era were actually better on the ST or not even
released on the Amiga.
This said, the Amiga had better action games, especially space shooters.
But practically, it was handicapped by one button joysticks (in fact, the
Amiga could handle two buttons, but game developpers overlooked this feature).


Q:
Which TOS should I use?
A:
Generally, TOS 1.02 is the most compatible for STF mode, and TOS 1.62 for STE
mode. Steem will try to match those TOS when you switch ST model, if option
'Hacks' is checked.
Some rare programs prefer another version, like TOS 1.00 for very old games,
or even depend on a country specific TOS.
TOS1.00 STF
TOS1.02 STF
TOS1.04 STF
TOS1.06 STE
TOS1.62 STE
TOS2.05 Mega STE
TOS2.06 Mega STF/STE
TOS3.0X TT
TOS4.0X Falcon


Q:
Shouldn't all programs work with all TOS? I prefer TOS X.YZ.
A:
No, mostly due to bad coding practices, some programs will only work with
such or such TOS. Memory option may also be important, and of course the ST
model.
I won't check reported "bugs" under an unusual TOS without knowing for sure
that it should work.


Q:
Hey my shortcut for F12 doesn't work anymore!
A:
This is by design. F12 will start/stop emulation in Steem like in some other
emulators. I ignore requests to the contrary or to make it optional.


Q:
Help! Something went wrong and now even quitting and restarting Steem 
doesn't help.
A:
Try deleting the file 'auto.sts' in Steem's directory. It can get corrupted.
In rare cases of very bad corruption you may even need to delete or edit 
steem.ini.


Q:
Help! I reset the ST, stop and start Steem, delete auto.sts and I just get
a blank screen.
A:
Check options ST model and TOS. With STF and TOS1.6, you'll have a blank
screen. 


Q:
Steem can't handle zip or rar or 7z files.
A:
Check that necessary DLL files are in your Steem folder (or your system
folder).


Q:
I find scrollers and games jerky compared with a real ST.
A:
Emulation is precise enough but smooth scrolling depends on your own 
hardware. You need a video card and a monitor capable of displaying at
the exact emulated frequency, 50hz most of the time.
I have such a 50hz display and it's almost perfect with VSync.
If your hardware is set to 60hz or 75hz, for example, it's impossible
to have really smooth 50hz scrollers. You may check this using a 60hz
program (ReadMe -TEX, HighResMode -PDX...).


Q:
Steem needs much time at first run.
A:
It depends on the system, apparently it's due to sound initialisation.


Q: 
The sound filters all sound the same.
A:
They apply only on PSG sound, not DMA (STE).


Q:
I have problems with sound!
A:
Me too!
It isn't easy to fix.
There have always been sound issues on the PC. Steem authors provided some
options to help, just in case.
The options that should make the most sense are:
- Default sound driver
- Don't check 'write to primary buffer', it's a hack!
- Timing method: 'write cursor'
- Delay 20ms if your computer can handle it
- Frequency: depends on your hardware (44.1k is generally fine) and the
program (50066 may sound better for some STE programs).
- Format: 16bit stereo is advised.
- Volume: if you're not satisfied, it could help to set it to max and use
your Windows control panel to adjust. Though in recent versions of Steem SSE,
the volume slider has been fixed.


Q:
Sometimes I lose keyboard control.
A:
Me too. Don't know the cause. It's not an emulation issue if quitting and 
restarting Steem gives you control back.


Q:
Joysticks don't seem to be read correctly.
A:
Please first check that option 'Ports/Special adapters' doesn't interfere.


Q:
After starting Steem SSE on my machine, it asks for D3DX9_43.dll.
A:
Your DX9 installation isn't complete. 
You may try to update it, or copy D3DX9_43.dll into Steem directory.
[available on my site: http://ataristeven.exxoshost.co.uk/Files/D3DX9_43.zip
 caution: 32bit only]


Q:
I copied D3DX9_43.dll to the Steem directory, but still Steem refuses to
start (application error (0xc00007b)). 
I had no problem with previous Steem versions.
A:
This is a common DirectX install error, no Steem bug.
You had no problem with previous (before 3.7) Steem versions because those
didn't use D3D.
Here are some hints:
- This error seems to be caused by calling into a 64 bit DLL from a 32 bit app
or vice versa.
This error message may occur on 64 bit operating systems when the Microsoft 
Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package is not properly configured.
You may try to reinstall it. 
- Apply all Windows updates
- Reinstall .Net Framwork 4.5.1
- Copy the following files into Steem folder:
d3d9.dll
d3dx9_43.dll
xinput1_3.dll 
If it doesn't help, some search engine will be more useful than me.
There is also a DirectDraw build available in case it really won't work.


Q:
What is the difference between the D3D and the DirectDraw (DD) build?
A:
The main difference is in fullscreen mode. The DD build uses 800x600 (with
borders on) while the D3D uses any resolution you choose. There are other
options available.


Q:
What's the difference between ACSI and GEMDOS hard drives?
A:
ACSI emulation is lower level, it operates on image files of hard disks,
and should work as on a real Atari.
GEMDOS emulation directly uses folders on your PC hard drive and intercepts
TOS commands. It is more convenient but less compatible. 


Q:
Are state snapshots (.STS) compatible between versions?
A:
While there's no 100% guarantee, we try to maintain compatibility.
It's useful for me too, to quickly compare versions in case of bugs.


Q:
What is the "wake-up state"?
A:
It is the state in which your ST booted, due to synchronisation between 
various chips. It has an influence on shifter trick timings.
You may generally ignore this option, it is useful only to check the
display of some rare demos. Those are mentioned in 'Hints'.


Q:
Hey you claim to have fixed this or that issue with drive emulation but when
I try it doesn't work.
A:
All drive emulation improvements operate only if the option 'Accurate Disk
Access Times (Slow)' is checked in the Disk manager, for ST, MSA, DIM, STW
and HFE disk images.
For IPF, CTR, and SCP disk images, the option isn't necessary as emulation
is slow anyway :) 
For STX images, settings are in 'Pasti configuration', but you want maximum
accuracy.


Q:
Hey, you claim you fixed file associations, but it doesn't work on my computer.
A:
For it to work you first need to manually remove the associations in the
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT part of the registry, that were put by previous versions of
Steem.
By the way, with most files zipped, file association makes less sense.


Q:
There's a strange bug, the keyboard doesn't click like on a real ST.
A:
If you really want that click, check the sound options, Steem gives you
the choice.


Q:
Steem stutters when loading a SCP game.
A:
If it is in 7Z format, delay is the price of high compression.


Q:
Is support for Falcon planned?
A:
No. To me those machines, like the TT, have no interest.
Steem SSE is strictly STF/STE (Steen not SSE is STE-only).
Atari supported Falcon only for a few months, and little software was
developed. Software was so specialised in audio it is very hard to emulate,
not to mention protections. Only some professionals in audio production
would be interested, and for this end Steem should be a paying tool anyway.
Now nothing keeps dedicated people from starting a Falcon branch of Steem.


Q:
What about Mega STE emulation?
A:
Maybe one day. First need to get one myself, or to have some really good
tester with one. 


Q:
What's the use of the STW disk image format?
A:
A STW disk image is the simplest possible MFM encoding format of
Atari ST floppy disks. 
It allows correct emulation of WD1772 command 'Format'.

Q:
What is the 'Boiler'?
A:
The Boiler is the amazing debugger coded by Steem authors. It is Steem with a 
parallel window where you can check code, memory, etc., just using a powerful
IDE. The name is a probable reference to 'Steam' and 'Engine'.
Of course the SSE version contains many improvements. It is Windows 32-only.


Q:
Doesn't the boiler icon look like a garbage bin?
A:
The icon's internal name is 'debug_trash.ico', so it seems to be on purpose!
Why exactly only Steem authors know. It may be a way to say that not all
programs on the platform were that good.


Q:
I want to contribute some code!
A:
Please do. I like to brag about all I do myself but any help is appreciated.
Especially help with ports would be useful.
All you have to do is use subversion, and send me a message at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/steemsse/
If you don't like this versioning software, just submit your ideas at
atari-forum:
http://www.atari-forum.com/viewforum.php?f=94
Or send me an e-mail.


Q:
I'd like to help but can't code.
A:
You can help by testing stuff and reporting bugs.


Q:
I can't code, I won't help, I use Linux (only recently switched from Amiga
OS), Hatari is better than Steem, fullscreen don't work, STW is useless, I
enjoy trashing your Coming Soon threads at Atari-Forum (who cares?), you suck,
Aikido is fake, in fact Steven Seagull's movies are notoriously bad, 
that's why all his releases are DTV!
