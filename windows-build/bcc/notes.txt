Script files to compile Steem SSE with Borland C++ 5.5.
This was Steem's original compiler and it's still used for 
development builds.

The SET variables need to be edited according to your system 
(build_bcc_set.bat).

build_bcc_asm.bat must be called first if asm files haven't been assembled 
yet.

build_debug.bat will build Steem Boiler SSE.

build_user.bat will build regular Steem SSE.

build_modules_user.bat will use makefil2.txt to build Steem as released by
Steem Authors (3.2+)
