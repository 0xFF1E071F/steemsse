The CPU and the MMU share access to the RAM bus: 2 cycles each every 4
cycles.

The wake up state is randomly determined at cold reset, with a state being
more probable than another, depending on temperature too.

It affects the order of cycles sharing for each chunk of 4 clock cycles.

The reference is cycle 0 at cold reset.

The more practical reference is the start of scanline in the 'shifter trick 
reckoning', the latter meaning the cycles that are targeted to obtain certain
effects. EG: cycle 376 for right border removal. The important thing is of 
course that wake up state has an influence on those tricks.

We call the wake up states '1' and '2'.
To reduce confusion (if possible), we will try to define wake up states so
that the demo 'Forest' by Paolo gives us the same numbers as those we use.

Sync 0-byte line
------------------

In Steem in STF mode, 'Forest' will return state 1 or 2 according to the
following rule:

In wake up state 1, changing frequency to 60 at cycle 56 then back to
50 at cycle 64 will confuse the shifter and produce a 0 byte line (no
memory fetching, a black line is drawn).

In wake up state 2, changing frequency to 60 at cycle 58 then back to
50 at cycle 68 will confuse the shifter and produce a 0 byte line (no
memory fetching, a black line is drawn).

State (STF)            1                      2
Switch to 60          56                     58                      
Switch to 50          64                     68
CPU cycles         56-57                  58-59
Shifter cycles     58-59                  56-57

We derive the schemas that show how every 4 cycles are shared.
They start at cycle 0 and all multiples of 4 after that.

Right border off
------------------

The 'magic cycle' to remove the right border is 376.

In wake-up state 2, a write on cycle 374 will not work.
But in wake-up state 1, it will be delayed by the MMU and hit cycle 376.

State 1
+-----+
| CPU |   372
+-----+
| MMU |   374 -> delayed to 376, right border trick will work

State 2
+-----+
| MMU |   372
+-----+
| CPU |   374 -> taken, right border trick missed
+-----+


Palette
---------

Logic says that palette changes may be delayed if we hit when the bus isn't
 available (second chunk in state 1, first chunk in state 2).
The delay would be 2.
But there's still a delay of 1 that must be added to all changes in Steem.
I didn't see it in Hatari so it may have nothing to do with emulation.
