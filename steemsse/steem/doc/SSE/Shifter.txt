Shifter

Steem SSE development notes mostly based on ijor's insights.
This replaces my former ramblings.

The Shifter has two internal 4bit counters:

pixel counter 
init to 4 at borders so that it won't overwrap during a LOAD signal

LOAD counter 
4bit but works by shifting a 1, so it counts 1-4 then it
is reset by Shifter internal Reload
This corresponds to our Shifter.Preload variable

Reload pulse
reload of the shift registers (IR => RR)
It happens when LOAD counter = 4 and pixel counter = 16
timing: 1 pixel



Still don't understand:
why the right-off 2 extra words have no effect, but when you destabilise as 
in the bee demos, the 2 extra words do have effect (shift planes and pixels)
