Steem SSE Bugs
===================

v3.8.1

2) Please don't report bugs that are already known, think of my reputation!

blitter is working

-HFE no fast mode

-hi-fi dreams should sound better on STE

display totally wrong on STE (correct)

-Paste text into ST incompatible with option C1 (no surprise)

-Pasti: failure on resume snapshot

-Pasti: some games that work in Hatari don't in Steem
This is because pasti.dll should be improved, the fault isn't on
Steem's side. (eg Jupiter's Masterdrive)

Is it Steem or TOS bug?

-Star Trek
