Introduction
==============

In the STE, the GLUE and the MMU are one single chip, the GST MCU

Name
======

MMU stands for Memory Manager Unit. 
It is a very simple chip. There's no paging, cache management, etc.

Registers
===========

Video Base:                                            
$FFFF8201    0 0 X X X X X X   High Byte     
$FFFF8203    X X X X X X X X   Mid Byte      
$FFFF820D    X X X X X X X 0   Low Byte      VBASELO  STE-only

Address of the picture to display on next VBL.

Video Counter:
$FFFF8205  High Byte
$FFFF8207  Mid Byte
$FFFF8209  Low Byte

Address being decoded at this instant.
STF: read-only, STE: R/W
The video counter has many names, in Steem it's is the shifter draw pointer 
(SDP).

Alien:
    The MMU uses the GLUE's Vsync signal to  reset the video counter  with the 
    contents of $FFFF8201 and $FFFF8203 (you may also add $FFFF820D on STE).


$FFFF820F  LINEWID  STE-only
Used for horizontal scrolling, #words to add the the SDP at the end of the
scanline.


Sharing
=========

Even memory accesses are given to CPU/Blitter/DMA while odd cycles are reserved
for DRAM refresh or used by Shifter for displaying contents of the frame buffer.

Note: if that's always true then wake-up state doesn't depend on this.

DE
====

When the MMU gets the DE signal from the GLUE, it fetches video memory
word by word, every 500ns, or 4 cycles, and raises signal LOAD so that
the Shifter knows that data is available.
Each time it has fetched a word, it increments the video counter.

When the MMU sees the  VSync signal  from the GLUE, it resets the video counter
with the contents of $FFFF8201 and $FFFF8203 (and $FFFF820D on STE).
It also resets VCTR at this time.

When DE is false, the MMU doesn't fetch video, it refreshes DRAM, and on the
STE it fetches DMA sound.








?:
This integrated circuit controls the Dynamic RAM signals. It is not as powerful 
as the name suggests, it doesn’t do any memory protection, translation from
 virtual to physical address or paging. 
This would be better called a Memory Controller Unit. It multiplexes
the CPU address lines to Column and Rows. It also contains a counter for 
sending video data from RAM to the SHIFTER and also a counter for DMA transfers.

CPU controls the main bus. MMU controls the RAM data bus. Both are isolated by 
a couple of small TTL chips. 

For accesing the RAM bus, MMU allocates 250ns for the main bus 
(CPU/DMA/Blitter) and 250ns for itself (video, STe sound and RAM refresh). 

If the CPU performs an aligned bus cycle, then MMU can service it immediately 
and activates DTACK without delay. If the CPU attempts a misaligned access, 
then MMU inserts wait states by delaying DTACK. 

The TTL chips buffer the data because CPU owns the main bus during both time 
slots.


GLUE has internally a 2Mhz clock (period equivalent to one NOP) for the video 
state machine. MMU has a 4Mhz clock to round robin grant bus access to the CPU 
or to the SHIFTER (modified version)

The two clocks are in perfect phase. This means that the active edge of the 
2Mhz clock coincides with the 4Mhz one. The 2Mhz clock toggles an internal 
flip-flop. But the initial state of the flip-flop is not deterministic at power 
up. 

Then, in one wakeup mode, the CPU is granted access concurrently with the 2Mhz 
period. In the other, it is the SHIFTER.
