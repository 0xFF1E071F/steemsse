Since v3.7, the main build is the VS2008 one (before, it was VC6).
The BCC build is much used for development. It lacks ArchiveAccess support.
The MinGW build is experimental (did work at some point, but stopped following
it).
There's a working VS2015 build since v3.8.2. 
There's a x64 build since v3.8.2 (VS2008 or VS2015). It uses C for drawing
instead of assembly.
