Steem SSE uses makefiles with txt extension, because of the way some
backup tools work.

To build XSteem SSE, enter this in the terminal:
make -B -fMakefile.txt 3rdparty
make -B -fMakefile.txt

To build the debug build, enter this:
make -B -fMakefile_dbg.txt 3rdparty
make -B -fMakefile_dbg.txt

The 2 step process was already the way for previous Steem versions.
It is justified by slow building of some 3rd party software.

If you get compilation errors, you should update your configuration based on
hints given by the compiler.
